                            Sit back and relax now. Don’t be in a hurry. Don’t
                            close the browser too quickly, because what you are
                            about to experience will blow your mind. You will
                            walk through a terrible design, horrible layout,
                            structure, and architecture of this website. The
                            colors will be terribly imbalanced and confusing.
                            The only honest and true thing on this website is
                            the content—we got that right. Everything else is
                            unfortunate. Yet, it is done with great style,
                            passion, and dedication. Despite the fact that the
                            design is really, really bad, it is unique—like you
                            and me. We believe we have controlled the chaos. We
                            made it harmonious and ordered amidst all this mess.
                            We are helping your eye flow through the text, from
                            piece to piece, from letter to letter. And we did
                            that intentionally. You might hate this design, but
                            you can’t stay neutral. It is impossible to create a
                            design that everyone will love, but it is possible
                            to create one that everyone will remember.

                            Remember this website because it will leave its
                            footprint in the history of the internet. How
                            foolish, but at the same time brave, was the creator
                            of it. He made every possible mistake from design
                            theory, but he made them with a bang.
